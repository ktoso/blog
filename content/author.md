  - Primarily focused on Swift Concurrency (actors, distributed actors, structured concurrency, etc.), and improving the language user-experience, with a focus towards for serverside use-cases. 
  - Created and maintaining foundational telemetry libraries (e.g. [swift-distributed-tracing](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing)), as well as language interoperability with [Java](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-java).
  - Designed or co-authored multiple [Swift evolution proposals](https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution/#?search=konrad%20malawski).

## Previously

* **Akka** at Lightbend (previously Typesafe)
  - maintained and designed multiple modules of the Akka ecosystem, including core, streams, cluster, as well as akka http and persistence (CQRS).
  * [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) – core team member, maintained various modules, including core, cluster as well as persistence.
  * [**Akka HTTP**](https://github.com/akka/akka-http) – core team, lead maintainer for a period of time
* [**Reactive Streams**](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm) – co-designed the types and protocol while part of the Akka team, along with various industry implementors and project leads (RxJava, Reactor, etc.), also implemented the Technology Compatibility Kit which allowed implementations to test their conformance to the specification. 
  * Reactive Streams were the blueprint of [java.util.concurrent.**Flow**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html) which was included in Java9 as part of [JEP-266: More Concurrency Updates](https://openjdk.org/jeps/299)
* Maven [**git commit maven id plugin**](https://github.com/git-commit-id/maven-git-commit-id-plugin) - a Maven build plugin created to emit and retain git build information into released projects; Used by large number of open and closed source projects across the entire Java ecosystem.
* [**sbt-jmh**](https://github.com/ktoso/sbt-jmh) and **sbt-jol** – The best integration for OpenJDK's JMH benchmarking tool with sbt (the Scala build tool)

## Community

* **GeeCON** – conference organizer (2011~2017); ~1,200-person software engineering conference centered around the JVM,
