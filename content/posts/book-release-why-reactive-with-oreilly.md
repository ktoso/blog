O'Reilly recently reached out to me to write a small report / mini-book about reactive systems and architectures. The report is structured around explaining the various aspects of Reactive. Tracking it's origins, through Reactive Programming (in chapter 2 "Reactive on the Application level") and Reactive Systems (in chapter 3 "Reactive on the System level").

The book does not focus on any single implementation or library, and rather discusses the conceptual goals, benefits and trade-offs such architectures bring with them.

If you're curious what this reactive is about, I'd like to invite you to give it a read. As it's a report, it is available for free, you just need to go to: **[Why Reactive? Download the report](https://bit.ly/why-reactive)**.

- Update: It is also available as article directly online here on **[O'Reilly Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/why-reactive?ref=kto.so)**.
- Update 2: Some reviews made it to [**GoodReads**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32807675-why-reactive?ref=kto.so), thanks everyone. üôè

I'd like to thank everyone who helped me writing this report‚Äìespecially Jonas Bon√©r for his invaluable feedback‚Äìthank you.
