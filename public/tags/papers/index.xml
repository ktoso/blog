      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post was originally written on 16 May 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last years I&amp;rsquo;ve been had the privilege of traveling quite a bit and been able to attend various conferences and user group meetings in various countries. Yet, I&amp;rsquo;m still to find another as awesome and life-changing (sic, not an over-statement) group as &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20180816224526/http://sckrk.com/&#34;&gt;SCKRK&lt;/a&gt; â€“ yet, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably never heard of it. Which is not surprising really since it&amp;rsquo;s a local and technically speaking small initiative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
